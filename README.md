# wavEMS
EMS controls via audio signals  
  
  
EMS waves generated by audio.  
  
RN-52, piezo amp, converters, powered by 9V battery.  
  
## Issues  
- due to the filter, the amplitude are not the same for all wave forms  
- consumes high current. maybe changing the resistor can slightly solve this.
