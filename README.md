# wavEMS
EMS controls via audio signals  
  
  
EMS waves generated by audio.  
  
RN-52, piezo amp, DC-DC converters, powered by 3.7V Li-ion battery.  
  
## Issues  
- due to the filter, the amplitude are not the same for all wave forms  
- consumes high current. maybe changing the resistor can slightly solve this.  
  
  
# Components  
RN-52: Bluetooth Module  
[Breakout+Amp](https://shop.emergeplus.jp/hachiware-btamp-kit/)  
or any other breakouts (but requires to remove the input resistor from the following Amplifier)  
  
IFJM-001: Piezo Amplifier  
[IFJM-001](https://www.marutsu.co.jp/pc/i/1099677/)  
  
LTC3124: DC-DC Covertor (used to convert 3.7V input to 12V)  
[LTC3124](https://strawberry-linux.com/catalog/items?code=13124)  
  
MIWI06-24D05: DC-DC Convertor (used to convert 12V to +5V and -5V)  
[MIWI06-24D05](http://akizukidenshi.com/catalog/g/gM-06536/) 
  
  
# Implementation  
- Connect battery to LTC3124.
- Connect 12V output of LTC3124 to MIWI06-24D05 and IFJM-001.
- Connect +5V output of MIWI06-24D05 to IFJM-001 and RN-52, and -5V to IFJM-001.
- Connect RN-52 output to IJFM-001 input.
- Use 3.9kΩ resistor for the IJFM-001 bus voltage adjusting pins.
- Include a current limiting fuse etc. for safety.
